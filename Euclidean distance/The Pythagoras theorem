# Pythagoras theorem

# The programs purpose is to calculate the distances in between two points in 2D space.

class Point: # class is used to store coordinates of a point. 
    def __init__(self, x, y): 
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        
# They're meant to read coordinates for Point A & B from the user perspective.        
x1 = float(input("Enter x1: "))
y1 = float(input("Enter y1: "))
x2 = float(input("Enter x2: "))
y2 = float(input("Enter y2: "))

# These lines with two variables in them create two distinct point objects with data in them.
pointA = Point(x1, y1)
pointB = Point(x2, y2)

# distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).
distance = ((pointB.x - pointA.x)**2 + (pointB.y - pointA.y)**2)**0.5

# for the result to be printed in the code.
print(f"the distance between the is: {distance}")

# The Example of the input:
# input for running the module: (x1 = 3, y1 = 5, x2 = 7, y2 = 9)

# The Expected output:
# the distance between the is: 5.656854249492381
